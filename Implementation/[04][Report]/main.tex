\section{\normalsize INTRODUCTION}

{\scshape T}he Variable Geometry Truss (VGT) systems, composed of linearly actuated truss members and passive rotational joints, offer adaptability across wide range of applications. These robotic systems have the capability to alter their shape and topology significantly through coordinated actuation of their linear members. The foundational concept of VGT systems was introduced by Miura et al., with a primary focus on fixed configurations with crane structure \cite{miura}. Subsequent advancements in the field involved the exploration of VGT as a modular and mobile system by Hamlin et al. \cite{hamlin}, expanding the scope of potential applications. Furthermore, Usevitch et al. contributed to the literature by introducing kinematic analysis and optimization-based locomotion for VGT systems \cite{usevitch}, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamic capabilities of these robotic structures. The control of robots with a large degrees of freedom is important leverage that allows robots to adapt to the wide variety of tasks.

The prior research focused on various aspects of the system, with an emphasis on locomotion. The problem addresses the kinematic relationships to determine a series of size changes in member lengths that enable the desired motion of the whole structure. In the case of complex truss structures, the rigidity of the topology and mechanical constraints contribute to a large solution space. Consequently, solving this problem necessitates the optimization-based methods. The present work builds upon the foundation, incorporating kinematic relations and derivations. Specifically, the kinematic relations and optimization methodology stems from the insights provided by Usevitch et al. \cite{usevitch}. 

The second facet of research concerning VGT systems involved path planning from a higher-level perspective, with the objective of navigating the environment to reach the goal position. Existing literature in this domain concentrated on employing probabilistic methods, with a specific emphasis on the Polygonal Random Tree search (PRT) algorithm, forming the foundational basis for the current study. It is noteworthy to highlight that prior work on path planning focused strictly on scenarios involving planar terrains and well-defined obstacles.

The objective of this study is to extend the current understanding of VGT systems by advancing both the kinematic relations and the nonlinear optimization problem, in terms of adapting it for irregular terrain scenarios. Additionally, from a higher-level planning perspective the PRT algorithm is aimed to be expanded to address challenges posed by more complex terrains and the obstacles laying coherently in real-world environments.

\section{VARIABLE GEOMETRY TRUSS SYSTEM}

\begin{figure}[t!]

\end{figure}
In the context of a network of linear actuators within a Variable Geometry Truss (VGT) system, determining node positions by manipulating edge lengths is a non-trivial task. Each link length imposes a constraint on the node positions, and the challenge is to find positions that satisfy all these constraints, accounting for translation and rotation of the entire network. The rigidity of the underlying graph plays a pivotal role, with different classes of solutions emerging based on this rigidity. For instance, if the system of equations yields infinite solutions, indicating non-rigidity, the framework allows movement relative to itself without violating length constraints. Conversely, a rigid framework possesses a discrete number of solutions, and any deflection of the system relative to itself violates the length constraints. A simple example on the rigidity is a parallelogram with passive joints, this mechanism is under-constrained and the solution for the edge lengths result in variety of node positions. However if one connect two non-neighbouring edges then with the new length constraint the system becomes rigid. The analysis of device kinematics and system constraints in subsequent sections will be an important step in terms of tacking the robot locomotion task.

\subsection{\small{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont O}VERVIEW}

The chosen topology for the VGT robot is an octahedron, consisting of 6 nodes and 12 members, as illustrated in Figure ~\ref{robot}. The robot's structure can be represented as a graph $\mathbf{G}$, which comprises a node set $\mathbf{N} = \{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_6\}$ referring to the vertices of the robot. The connectivity or adjacency set, denoted as $\mathbf{A}$, wires specific nodes together, defining the structure through elements like $\{\{n_1, n_2\}, \{n_2, n_3\}, \dots, \{n_6, n_4\}\}$. Additionally, the member length set, denoted as $\mathbf{L}$, serves as an analogous representation for the edges of the robot, with $\mathbf{L} = \{l_1, l_2, \dots, l_{12}\}$ which are the edge lengths. The nodes in three-dimensional matrix form are expressed as $\mathbf{n_i} = \begin{bmatrix} n_{i_x} & n_{i_y} & n_{i_z} \end{bmatrix}$, where each $n_i$ represents a node. Lastly, the vector $\mathbf{x}$ denotes the position of all the nodes $\mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix} n_{1_x}& \dots & n_{6_x} & n_{1_y} & \dots & n_{6_y} & n_{1_z} & \dots & n_{6_z} \end{bmatrix}$ which will come in handy in Jacobian construction.

\subsection{\small{\fontsize{10}{10}\selectfont K}INEMATICS}

The kinematic structre of the robot is plainly simple, the relations stem from the distances between two connected nodes, that is 
\begin{equation*}
    L_k = \| n_i - n_j \| \  \forall \{n_i,n_j\} \in N 
\end{equation*}
and expanding this relation into matrix form results in 
\begin{equation*}
    \dot L = R \dot x
\end{equation*}
which is the inverse kinematics equation in matrix form. The result is named inverse kinematic sincce the node point configuration is analogous to the end effector position where the three-dimensional coordinates are used only to locate the nodes, and the length of the members are analogous to the joint positions in a serial manipulator. The matrix representation of the topology is given below

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
     L_1    \\
     L_2    \\
     \vdots \\
     L_{12}\\
\end{bmatrix}_{12\times1}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    R_{1-1}(x) & R_{1-2}(x) & \dots & R_{1-18}(x) \\
    R_{2-1}(x) & R_{2-2}(x) & \dots & R_{2-18}(x) \\
    \vdots    & \vdots    & \ddots& \vdots    \\
    R_{12-1}(x)& R_{12-2}(x)& \dots & R_{12-18}(x)\\
\end{bmatrix}_{12\times18}
    
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
     x_1    \\
     x_2    \\
     \vdots \\
     x_6 \\
     y_1 \\
     \vdots \\
     z_{6}\\
\end{bmatrix}_{18\times1}
\end{equation*}
The length vector is by size 12 and node vector is of size 18, the resultant Jacobian matrix which is derived from the norm function incorporating the connectivity for all nodes is of size 12x18.  

This octahedral configuration is considered rigid, once the six degrees of freedom in space are constrained, the robot remains fixed. The structural rigidity of the octahedron can be demonstrated through a set of linear system equations, proving the immobility of the robot when certain constraints are applied.

%

The robot have a multiple rigid links each connected to the previous one with a rotational joint and the joint location is selected from the previous link, as depicted in the Fig.~\ref{robot}.

For the adjustment of individual lengths and widths, along with the addition of any number of links with individual joint locations. This flexibility facilitates the generation of a variety of robot topologies, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{topologies}. However, it's important to note that the constructed robots cannot form closed chains, as doing so requires solving kinematic equations to enable movement. This limitation becomes a topic for further discussion and exploration in future work.

The configuration space for the robots, that having multiple links, is in the form of $R^2*S^1*S^1*...*S^1$. This configuration can be represented with $q = [ x \ y \ \theta_1 \ \theta_2 \ ... \ \theta_n ]$. The angles in clockwise direction and allow for the full rotation without the robot colliding with itself, one can think about it as the links are on different planes.

\subsection{{\fontsize{11}{10}\selectfont W}ORKSPACE CONFIGURATION}

The workspace comprises a planar map bounded by an adjustable-size rectangle. Planar obstacles, taking the form of polygonal shapes, are placed to restrict the robot's freedom within this workspace. Both the initial and goal configurations are predefined, with careful consideration to ensure they avoid collisions with the obstacles initially. Notably, the obstacles are static and shapes remain constant over time without any variations. Unlike a grid-based structure, the workspace is not laid out over a grid, freeing the sampling process from dependence on such a structured grid for selection. This characteristic allows for a more flexible and adaptive sampling approach in navigating the robot through the dynamic environment.




\section{\large \textbf{Probabilistic Roadmap Planning}}
The fundamental PRM algorithm, extensively detailed in the reference book \cite{choset}, can be summarized as a multi-step process. Initially, the PRM method start by generating a set of robot configuration samples within the free workspace. After ensuring collision-free configurations, the algorithm proceeds to connect these samples, now referred to as nodes, to other nodes. During this connectivity phase, the PRM algorithm rigorously checks for collision-free transitions between nodes. Each such transition is identified as an edge, and the determination of the number of these edges involves considering the neighboring k nodes. In essence, the PRM method constructs a network of nodes and edges, effectively representing a roadmap that captures feasible paths through the configuration space while addressing collision constraints. The important aspect comes in when the algorithm does not need a precise description of the workspace obstacles. This approach provides a versatile and scalable solution for robot motion planning in complex environments.

% The subsequent sections will dvelve into the details about the implementation and how the algorithm is used with 

\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont LOCAL PLANNER}
The initial phase of the PRM approach involves sampling the workspace, a critical step in constructing a comprehensive roadmap for robot motion planning. For a more thorough exploration, a local planner is implemented. This local planner employs a systematic approach: it randomly samples throughout the entire workspace, and if a collision is encountered during this sampling process, the respective sample is discarded. The randomness in the sampling step is achieved by utilizing the random function, without any modifications or altering the sampling density.

The randomly generated samples in this context represent distinct configurations of the form $q = [ x \ y \ \theta_1 \ \theta_2 \ ... \ \theta_n ]$ . Each sample corresponds to a random configuration in the configuration space, and these samples are subsequently referred to as nodes for further reference. The sampling process continues until the required sample count is reached, with each generated configuration is valid and adheres to the defined constraints. 

The sample count serves as a critical parameter in PRM implementation, influencing the quality and efficiency of the obtained solutions. In general, a higher sample count tends to yield more optimal solutions. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory and computational intensity, impacting not only the sample generation phase but also subsequent steps in the algorithm. As the difficulty of the problem increases—signified by a generated sample count an order of magnitude higher than the useful or applicable samples for the solution—it becomes necessary to use a larger number of samples. This ensures a more comprehensive exploration of the configuration space, increasing the likelihood of encountering useful samples in complex scenarios. In the experimentation , varying sample numbers are explored to understand their impact on solution quality and computational efficiency.

     \label{samples}
     \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont COLLISIONS AND LOCAL PATHS}
In the sampling step, collision checks are conducted straightforwardly by checking the intersection of generated configurations. This collision check is implemented using MATLAB's polyshape intersect function. The same function is employed for the inbounds check, creating a box with a hole on the outer perimeter of the map, ensuring that the generated samples remain within the valid workspace. This approach is both intuitive and efficient.

Once the samples are generated strictly within the free workspace, the next process involves establishing local connections which is more intricate.  It requires interpolating between configurations that are to be connected and checking for collisions at each interval. The process is depicted in the Fig~\ref{local-path}. While this approach may seem time-consuming, it ensures a thorough assessment of the trajectory's safety. This collision check ensures the feasibility of local connections.

Two techniques have been implemented to improve the computational efficiency of collision algorithms. The first technique checks whether two configurations are within each other's line of sight. This mechanism is employed just before the path interpolation. If the check results in a failure, the path interpolation is halted, and the path is discarded.

In second method, the collision check sequence is terminated whenever a collision is detected. The subsequent intervals are not checked. This strategy reduces unnecessary computational overhead, which is particularly necessary since this process being the most time consuming part of the PRM algorithm.

    \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont DISTANCE METRIC}
After establishing a method to disregard unusable paths, there exists another step precedes the construction of the roadmap. This step involves defining a metric that proves invaluable when comparing different paths, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. The robot configurations are represented as a combination of Euclidean distances in a plane, that are in $x-x'\ ,\ y-y'$ and angle differences corresponding to the number of links, $\theta_1-\theta_1' \ , \theta_2 - \theta_2' \ , \ ... \ , \theta_n - \theta_n'$. 

This configuration divide results in two distinct groups: translation and rotation. In constructing a distance metric, the introduction of different weights $W$ for each group is intended to guide the algorithm toward achieving the desired motion. With this approach, a "distance" between any two configurations can be calculated, however we will use it only for the nodes that are connectable.

% \begin{equation}
% \end{equation}

\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont CONSTRUCTING THE ROADMAP}
The groundwork and essential components have been established to pave the way for constructing the roadmap. This roadmap, functioning as a connection graph, is comprised of nodes or configurations situated in the free space. These nodes are interconnected through path collision checks, and the weights of these connections are determined by the distances between nodes. Essentially, the nodes represent configurations, and edges are formed between them if the connection does not result in a collision. It's noteworthy that the generated edges may be either unidirectional or bidirectional, contingent on collision checks for both forward and backward directions. This aspect is influenced by the periodicity of link rotation with respect to $2\pi$.

As the number of samples increases, the potential combinations for checking connections between nodes grows exponentially. To mitigate this problem, a method is employed to connect local nodes exclusively. Each node is examined for a fixed number, $K$, of neighboring edges. This constraint significantly reduces the number of potential combinations, resulting in a more manageable and computationally efficient solution. By focusing on local connections, the algorithm can prioritize relevant paths, offering a more generalizable and scalable approach.

The resultant weighted graph can be solved with various algorithms. The employed method utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is explained in more detail in~\cite{dijkstra}. This algorithm finds the sequence of nodes from any starting node to any destination node. In the implemented method, the first node is designated as the start node, and the last node is appended as the goal node. The pseudocode for the algorithm is provided below.

\section{\large \textbf{Experiments}}
The experiments are designed to find a balance between time-complexity and solution feasibility. The initial two experiments explore different link sizes and variations in robot topologies. Each sub-experiment aim observe the impact of sample count and neighbor number on the planning process. However, in certain instances, distinguishing the specific causes behind observed differences in results can be challenging, as multiple factors may contribute concurrently.

\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont EXPERIMENT-1}
The first experiment involves a single long bar that can move and rotate within a plane, and the objective is to guide it to a specified goal configuration. The considerable length of the bar adds an inherent challenge to the task. The starting position is located in the top right portion of the plane, while the goal configuration is positioned along the bottom horizontal axis. This setup creates a demanding scenario where the robot must navigate through the constrained environment to reach its destination. Although there are many ways for bar to navigate the search for more optimal solution is a key.

In the initial set of results illustrated in Fig.~\ref{bar-1}, the experiment is conducted with a sample count of one hundred and a neighbor number $K$, set to fifty. These parameter choices provide the algorithm with enough freedom to explore the solution space extensively. As a consequence, the resulting path is relatively straightforward.

The second set of results, Fig.~\ref{bar-2} closely resembles the first one, with the same parameters. However, a notable difference lies in the goal configuration, which is rotated by 180 degrees. This adjustment simplifies the task, making it easier for the algorithm to find an optimal solution. With the same parameters, the algorithm benefits from sufficient samples and computational time to navigate the configuration space effectively and identify an optimal path. These variations in goal configurations demonstrate the algorithm's adaptability to different scenarios, where solution complexity is influenced by both environmental constraints and the specific goal configuration.

In the final set of results, to increase the level of difficulty is introduced compared to the previous scenarios. As depicted in Fig.~\ref{bar-3}, the obstacles now occupy a larger portion of the workspace, imposing more constraints on the motion of the bar. Additionally, the rotation of the bar is more restricted. Interestingly, the enlarged obstacles compel the algorithm to sample configurations that are predominantly horizontal and vertical. This constraint facilitate reaching the goal more easily, as the bar aligns itself with these preferred directions, navigating through the constrained space in a more straightforward manner. 
\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont EXPERIMENT-2}
In the second experiment, the complexity is increased by introducing a new configuration to the robot with an added link. Despite this added complexity, the obstacles remain the same as in the previous experiment.

From the obtained results, it is notable that the algorithm successfully finds a solution within a relatively short timeframe. Fig.~\ref{two-link-1}, representing a more comprehensive search, reveals a path that approaches the goal following a shorter Euclidean distance. However, the links exhibit significant rotation with the selected node pattern. This pattern, characterized by a higher number of nodes due to the increased sample count and closer proximity of neighboring samples, results in a more erratic movement along the path. The increased jumpiness in movement is attributed to the higher density of neighboring samples, introducing a more pronounced change in angles between consecutive configurations.

In the subsequent test, the number of samples is intentionally reduced to 10 while keeping the neighbor count ($K$) constant. This adjustment leads to a connected graph again, but with more distant neighbors. Consequently, the robot moves more extensively between configurations, causing fewer jumps in movement. The resultant path occupies a larger portion of the free configuration space, but it remains a valid and rapid solution. This trade-off between sample count and neighbor distance highlights the flexibility of the probabilistic roadmap approach in adapting to different scenarios, allowing for a diverse range of valid solutions depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.

\subsection{\fontsize{10}{13}\selectfont EXPERIMENT-3}
In the following experiment, a more challenging map is introduced, featuring 16 obstacles arranged in a grid pattern. The robot configuration consists of a two-link structure set. The sample count is systematically increased, reaching 500 samples with 50 neighbors in the final iteration.
However, the resulting roadmap, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{no-solution}, indicates the toughness of the challenge. Although the sample count appears to be quite adequate, the connections between the samples do not form a usable path. The resultant graph is disjoint, compromising isolated islands that are not effectively connected. This observation underscores the delicate balance in selecting appropriate parameters, as a high sample count alone does not guarantee a well-connected roadmap. The interplay between sample count, neighbor number, and environmental constraints plays a crucial role in the algorithm's ability to navigate and connect configurations effectively. Adjustments may be necessary to achieve a more connected and usable roadmap in such challenging scenarios.

\section{\large \textbf{Observations}}
The preceding series of experiments revealed several key insights. Firstly, it demonstrated that optimality can be achieved through the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm, sometimes with relative ease. Interestingly, environmental factors, such as increased constraints in the space, can have varied effects, and in the case of the PRM algorithm, certain constraints can actually be advantageous, simplifying the problem-solving process. Furthermore, it was observed that a higher number of samples and closer neighbors tend to result in a more optimal path. However, an increase in node changes along the path, especially near the goal, may lead to unwanted transients. In such cases, a less optimal path where the robot can stretch its "arms" might be preferred.

Additionally, certain problems become notably challenging when the configuration of obstacles is altered. Cases with more spread obstacles tend to be harder to solve, emphasizing the increased complexity introduced by changing the arrangement of obstacles. Nevertheless, the total obstacle-free space can be significantly larger in such instances compared to previous examples.

\section{\large \textbf{TARS Scenario}}

In the final experiment, the environment is constrained to the vertical plane. The robot configuration is designed to resemble two-links and three-feet robot, drawing inspiration from the TARS robot in the movie Interstellar (as depicted in Fig.~\ref{tars-fig}). The planning task is further constrained by requiring the TARS projection onto the vertical 2D plane to navigate along a specified course with various obstacles situated at different elevations.

The specific constraints imposed on the TARS robot in the vertical plane introduce a more realistic representation of its movement, aiming to incorporate gravity effects. The key constraint is that TARS should have at least one or two feet on the ground during its traversal from the initial to the goal configuration. This constraint mimics the influence of gravity, preventing the robot from freely moving in the air.

To enforce this constraint, a sampling strategy is integrated into the local planner section of the algorithm. The robot is consistently sampled from a set of points that lie on the ground. These points are derived from the ground obstacle, with a slight offset to mitigate potential collisions. This sampling strategy ensures that the robot maintains contact with the ground throughout its motion.

Additionally, a noteworthy aspect of the sampling process is the variation in the sampled leg that touches the ground. This variation enables the robot to alter its ground foot throughout the path, enhancing its adaptability to different configurations and scenarios. By incorporating these constraints and sampling strategies, the algorithm ensures that TARS moves in a physically plausible manner on the vertical plane, adhering to the specified constraints while navigating through the environment.


\section{\large \textbf{Conclusions}}
The exploration of stochastic methods in robot motion control, particularly focusing on the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm, has demonstrated its effectiveness in navigating complex configuration spaces. Random sampling within the free configuration space, coupled with local planning and collision checks, forms the basis of PRM. This paper focuses on the implementation details of a PRM planner designed for a planar two-link robot navigating within a polygonal world. The experiments conducted aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the method's performance and adaptability in constrained environments.

The PRM approach proves to be versatile and scalable, accommodating diverse robot configurations and environmental conditions. The foundational steps involve precise problem definition, considering robot configurations and workspace configurations. The configuration space, represented as R2 * S1 * S1* ... * S1, enables flexibility in altering individual link lengths and widths, allowing for a variety of robot topologies.

The experiments, ranging from a single bar navigating a plane to a more complex two-link robot on a grid obstacle, offer valuable insights. Optimality is attainable through the PRM algorithm, with the adaptability to varying environmental constraints. The impact of sample count and neighbor number is evident, with higher values generally leading to more optimal paths but potentially introducing undesired transients.

The challenges posed by altered obstacle configurations highlight the algorithm's sensitivity to environmental changes. Spread obstacles increase the complexity, emphasizing the trade-off between obstacle distribution and total obstacle-free space. The experiment involving a TARS-like robot in a vertical plane further underscores the adaptability of the PRM approach to unique scenarios, navigating along specified courses with obstacles at different elevations.

In conclusion, the probabilistic roadmap algorithm stands as a successful motion planner, suitable for navigating unrestricted worlds and intricate robot configurations. The experiments showcase its capabilities, paving the way for further exploration and refinement in future work.
